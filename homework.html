    <li>Canabies</li>
    About canabies:
    What does it look like?
    Soft black resin, furry green leaves and hard brown lumps, 
    cannabis can look very different depending on its type – 
    but it all comes from cannabis plants.
    You’re most likely to come across these types:

    Weed
    Also known as grass, weed is made from drying out the leaves and flowering parts of the cannabis plant. It can look like dried herbs and is usually brownish-green in colour.

    Skunk
    This is the name given for particular strains of grass that are very strong. Skunk’s become very popular in recent years and is often bright, pale or dark green in colour and covered in tiny crystals.

    Hash/hashish
    Not nearly as common as it used to be, hash (or hashish) is made from the resin of the cannabis plant and can be black, brown, soft or hard – depending on the type.

    Cannabis oil
    This is a dark, sticky and honey-coloured substance that’s much less common than other types.

    'Dab'/'shatter'
    These are highly concentrated forms of cannabis that are extracted using butane. They come in a solid form known as 'dab' or 'shatter' and can be used as e-liquids in vape pens.

  What does it taste/smell like?
    Cannabis has a musky, sweet smell. Some of the more potent types of cannabis can have a stronger smell, but this isn’t a reliable guide to the strength of any particular batch.

    <li>Tobacco</li>
    About Tobacco:
    What does it look like?
    The leaves of the tobacco plant are picked, dried and then rubbed to produce a brown, flaky mixture.

    It is sold as factory-made cigarettes or as rolling tobacco, which is used to make hand-rolled cigarettes (roll-ups). It is also sold as shisha, which is smoked using a waterpipe (hookah).

    In the UK tobacco is sold in standard packs with no corporate branding and large picture health warnings.

    Tobacco has a strong and distinctive taste and smell. As well as the tobacco smoke that is inhaled into a smoker's lungs, there is secondhand smoke which is made up of the smoke exhaled by the smoker and the 'sidestream' smoke from the tip of the cigarette. More than 80 per cent of secondhand smoke is invistible and odourless.
        Physical health risks
    Physical health risks

    Tobacco smoke contains over 5,000 chemicals, many of which are poisonous including more than 70 which can cause cancer.There is no 'safer' type of smoked tobacco - roll-up cigarette are just as harmful as manufactured cigarettes and smoking shisha through a waterpipe doesn't remove the toxic chemicals. These include:

    Tar - a mixture of dangerous chemicals
    Arsenic - used in wood preservatives/ rat poison
    Benzene - an industrial solvent, refined from crude oil
    Cadmium - used in batteries
    Ethanol - used in anti-freeze
    Formaldehyde - used in mortuaries to embalm dead bodies
    Polonium-210 - a highly radioactive element
    Chromium - used to manufacture dye, paints and alloys
    Acrolein - formerly used as a chemical weapon
    Hydrogen cyanide - used as an industrial pesticide
    Carbon Monoxide - contained in exhaust fumes
    Ammonia - used to make fertilisers and explosives
    Smoking damages nearly every organ of the body. It causes:

    lung disease including emphysema and chronic bronchitis
    heart and circulatory disease including heart attack, stroke and narrowing of the arteries
    at least 15 types of cancer including lung, mouth, throat, stomach, liver, kidney, bowel, bladder and cervix
    Reduced fertility in both men and women
    Smoking can cause bones to become weakand brittle and increases the risk of osteoporosis in women. It also increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, eye disease and dementia.

    Smoking during pregnancy can harm the baby in the womb from day one. Every cigarette causes damage to both the mother-to-be and her baby. Smoking increases the risk of miscarriage, premature birth, stillbirth and sudden infant death. It makes it more likely that a woman will have life-threatening complications during pregnancy and labour, and that the baby will be too sick to go straight home after birth.

    Smoking also harms other people around you. Being exposed to secondhand smoke can cause lung disease, heart disease and even cancer. Children are particularly at risk because they have less developed airways, lungs and immune systems.

    Some people think shisha smoking is safer than cigarette smoking, but that isn’t the case. People smoke shisha for much longer periods of time than they smoke a cigarette, and in one shisha session you can be exposed to very high levels of toxic chemicals. There is also the added risk of picking up diseases such as herpes, hepatitis C or tuberculosis from sharing waterpipes.

    Mental health risks

    Smoking increases anxiety and tension. Smokers are also more likely than non-smokers to develop depression over time.

    Other effects from smoking:

    Smoking tobacco has lots of immediate effects, such as making your breath, hair and clothes smell.

    Smoking stops oxygen getting to the skin, making you more prone to spots and a dull complexion. Over time it can lead to premature aging, meaning more wrinkles and a so-called ‘cat’s bum’ mouth.

    The tar in tobacco smoke can lead to yellowed teeth and nails.

    <li>Cocaine</li>
    About Cocaine:
    What does it look like?
    There are three types of cocaine: coke, crack and freebase.

    Coke looks like a fine white powder
    Crack looks like small lumps or rocks
    Freebase looks like a crystallised powder
    What does it taste/smell like?
    Cocaine powder has a bitter ‘chemical’ taste and smell, while crack cocaine can smell like burnt plastic or rubber.
        This is a Class A drug, which means it's illegal to have for yourself, give away or sell.

    Possession can get you up to 7 years in prison, an unlimited fine or both.

    Supplying someone else, even your friends, can get you life in prison, an unlimited fine or both.

    Like drink-driving, driving when high is dangerous and illegal. If you’re caught driving under the influence, you may receive a heavy fine, driving ban, or prison sentence.

    If the police catch people supplying illegal drugs in a home, club, bar or hostel, they can potentially prosecute the landlord, club owner or any other person concerned in the management of the premises.
        Physical health risks
    Cocaine is risky for anyone with high blood pressure or a heart condition, but even healthy young people can have a fit, heart attack or stroke after using the drug.

    The risk of overdose increases if you mix cocaine with other drugs or alcohol.

    Over time, snorting cocaine damages the cartilage in your nose that separates your nostrils. Heavy users can lose this cartilage and end up with one large nostril and a misshapen nose.

    Taking cocaine when pregnant can damage your baby, cause miscarriage, premature labour and low birth weight.

    Regularly smoking crack can cause breathing problems and pains in the chest.

    Injecting cocaine can damage veins and cause ulcers and gangrene. Sharing needles or other injecting equipment can spread HIV and hepatitis infections too. It's also easier to overdose from injecting cocaine.

    Speedballing (injecting a mixture of cocaine and heroin) can have fatal results. A form of heroin called white heroin, is easily mistaken for cocaine and people have died or been hospitalised after snorting it thinking it was cocaine.

    Mental health risks
    Regular use of cocaine can make people feel:

    depressed
    run-down
    anxious
    paranoid
    Cocaine can bring previous mental health problems to the surface too, and if a relative has had mental health problems, there might be an increased risk for you.

    Social risks
    Frequent users find they begin to crave more of the drug – so it can become an expensive habit to keep up with.

    Environmental risks
    Cocaine doesn't just damage the people who take it. It wrecks the communities that it's grown in and leads to deforestation. Find out more about how cocaine wrecks communities.

    What is cocaine cut with?
    The purity of cocaine goes up and down depending on the market.

    A wrap of cocaine powder can be cut with many things, such as sugar or starch, but benzocaine is the most common.

    Benzocaine is a local anaesthetic that produces a numbing effect similar to cocaine, but without the cocaine high.

    <li>Alcohol</li>
    About Alcohol:
    Physical health risks
    Physical health risks

    Drinking alcohol causes a wide range of physical and mental health problems, either because of binge drinking or from regularly drinking more than 14 units per week.

    Binge drinking can lead to injuries from falls, accidents or assaults. Drinking above the low risk guidelines on a regular basis can cause illnesses such as depression, high blood pressure, stroke, liver disease, cancers of the throat, mouth breast and liver.

    Alcohol contributes to all kinds of problems in Britain, from violent crime to domestic violence to car-related deaths to missing work and unemployment.

    There are short-term risks like injuries and accidents which can happen because of being drunk. These can include head injuries, scars, and can sometimes be fatal. There are other short-term risks such as alcohol poisoning.

    Long-term risks come from regularly drinking alcohol over the low risk guideline over a long time. Then the risks of getting different diseases increase and can lead to illnesses, such as cancer, stroke, heart disease, liver disease, and damage to your brain and nervous system.

    Long-term effects include damage to the brain, body and its organs. This can take years to develop and can lead to a wide range of serious health problems, like cancers, that you may not realise are due to alcohol.

    Other chemical forms of alcohol, such as methanol (meths), Isopropanol and butanol, are much more toxic than ethanol and should not be consumed by humans.

    Counterfeit Alcohol
    The scientific name for the alcohol in drinks is ethanol or ethyl alcohol. Other types of alcohol, such as methanol and butanol, are much more toxic than ethanol and should not be consumed by humans, as they can cause severe liver damage, blindness and even death.

    Although counterfeit alcoholic drinks may contain these toxic forms of alcohol or other poisonous impurities, the vast majority of alcohol brought from legitimate sources will not.

    Counterfeit alcoholic drinks tend to be sold in places you wouldn’t normally buy alcohol, such as car boot sales, and sold at low prices. Sometimes, a clue to knowing that an alcoholic drink is counterfeit is its labelling and packing – there may be spelling mistakes, holographic labels aren’t holographic, etc.

    ‘Alcopops’ and ready-to-drink ‘mixers’ may not seem to be strong drinks but they may contain more alcohol than typical bottles or cans of beer or cider.
    Additional law details
    It’s against the law for anyone under 18 to buy alcohol in a pub, off-licence or supermarket or online.

    Anyone over 18 can buy and drink alcohol legally in licensed premises in Britain. But, a lot of shops operate a scheme called Challenge 21 where if you look under 21 (or 25 in some places) and don’t have proof of your age they will refuse to sell you alcohol.

    Children aged under 16 must be accompanied by an adult in a pub or bar.

    The police have the power to stop a person and confiscate alcohol in a public place if they reasonably suspect the person to be aged under 18. Young people under 18 who persistently drink or are found possessing alcohol in public places may be prosecuted.

    It’s illegal to give an alcoholic drink to a child under 5 except in certain circumstances (such as under medical supervision).

    It’s illegal for an adult to buy alcohol for someone aged under 18, except where that person buys beer, wine or cider for someone aged 16 or 17 to be drunk with a table meal while accompanied by a person over 18.

    It’s illegal to drive with more than 80 milligrams per 100 millilitres of blood in your system. People absorb alcohol at different rates and it’s difficult to judge how many drinks would put you over this legal limit, so because any amount of alcohol slows down reaction times, it’s safest not to drink at all before driving

    Official guidelines
    The UK Chief Medical Officers advise that an alcohol-free childhood is the healthiest and best option. However, if young people drink alcohol:

    It should not be until at least the age of 15 years.
    If young people aged 15 to 17 years consume alcohol, it should always be with the guidance of a parent or carer or in a supervised environment.
    Parents and young people should be aware that drinking, even at 15 or older, can be hazardous to health and that not drinking is the healthiest option for young people.
    If 15- to 17-year-olds do consume alcohol, they should do so infrequently and certainly on no more than one day a week.
    Young people aged 15 to 17 years should never exceed recommended adult daily limits and, on days when they drink, consumption should usually be below these levels.
    Adults are safest not to drink regularly more than 14 units per week, to keep health risks from drinking alcohol to a low level. And if they do drink as much as 14 units per week, it is best to spread this evenly over 3 days or more. If they want to cut down the amount they’re drinking, a good way to help achieve this is to have several drink-free days each week.

    <li>Meth/Methamphetamine</li>
    About Meth:
    What does it look like?
    Methamphetamine can come in several different forms – including tablets, powder, or crystals. 
    The tablets are sometimes referred to as yaba and the smokeable crystals are often called crystal meth or ice.
    Depending on its form, methamphetamine can be swallowed, snorted or injected.

    Smoking the purer, crystalline form of methamphetamine, known as crystal meth, produces a very intense high similar to that produced by 
    crack cocaine but much longer lasting.

    Sharing needles, syringes or other injecting equipment, runs the risk of the injector catching or spreading viruses, such as HIV or 
    hepatitis C. There is also the risk that veins may be damaged, and of abscesses or clots developing.
    Physical health risks
    Increased heart rate and blood pressure, raising the risk of heart attack – the higher the dose, the greater these effects.

    In cases of overdose: stroke, lung, kidney and gastrointestinal damage can develop, and coma and death can occur.

    There’s evidence that long-term methamphetamine use can cause brain damage, although this gradually gets better if the user stays off the drug for a long time.

    Inhibitions are lowered and libido may be increased – this can lead to taking part in risky activities that you would not normally do, such as having unsafe sex, which itself can lead to other risks, such as catching a sexually transmitted disease or an unplanned pregnancy.

    Mental health risks
    Severe psychosis caused by methamphetamine have been reported in countries where there is widespread use of the drug. Psychosis is a serious mental state where you lose touch with reality and may come to believe things that are not true.

    There’s evidence that long-term use can damage the brain, although this gradually gets better if the user stays off the drug for a long time.

    What is methamphetamine cut with?
    It’s not unusual for drugs to have things added to them to increase the weight and the dealer’s profits.

    They can be cut with other amphetamines (like speed, caffeine, ephedrine, sugars (like glucose), starch powder, laxatives, talcum powder, paracetamol and other drugs with some similar effects.

    Some impurities can be added by mistake, as impurities can be formed during the manufacturing process for methamphetamine.
    Is it dangerous to mix with other drugs?
    Mixing methamphetamine with alcohol can have serious consequences – as the stimulant effects of methamphetamine and the depressant effects of alcohol interact unpredictably, which can increase the risk of harm or even death.
